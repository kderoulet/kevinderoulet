                  As a Senior Software Engineer for a AKQA, I've supported a Sunnyvale Tech Giant, where I've played a key role in enhancing and supporting web apps and components within the Web Frameworks team. I’ve learned and grown continuously in this role, particularly in testing and deployment; I've closely collaborated with the Tech Giant's engineers to glean insights into their approach to stability and scalability. In addition to my core responsibilities, I've mentored the engineers on my team, facilitated engineering training, and held the team to the highest code standards. Most of my code contributions have been in the form of executing pixel-perfect, accessible UIs, building components utilized in Marketing and E-commerce pages throughout the Tech Giant's customer-facing and internal pages. I also briefly contracted with AKQA prior to 06/21 to do React work for IBM/Redhat.

                    I contracted with NIS America to enhance their technological offerings by building websites and reusable components for game-release marketing pages and their flagship NGPX conference. By developing component libraries and reusable APIs, I improved their development lifecycle. And using Google Analytics, I was able to bring improvements to the technical team, particularly improving their utilization of SEO and getting their CMS up-to-speed. My role involved analyzing, designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining web application components in a modern architecture based on React.js and Node.js, and moving the team toward a Google Cloud infrastructure. I had the opportunity to grow in my use of creative technologies like WebGL and Canvas for in-browser graphics. Finally, this was a great opportunity to mentor other developers, and was a great experience leading a small dev team.

                    As the lead engineer on the A’s Tech Innovation team, I architected and executed solutions to business needs. The apps I built were React- or JS-based on the front end, and used Node.js and Python along with Google Cloud’s infrastructure to power their data-heavy back-ends. I also split time on the Baseball Operations side of the Athletics, where I leveraged my Google Cloud knowledge to securely move our applications and data processes to the cloud.

          <h1>Interests</h1>
          <p>I've been a Software Engineer since doing a General Assembly Bootcamp in 2017. Technologically, I'm into WebGL, applied uses of AI, accessibility engineering, and the intersection of technology and marketing. A lot of my early work was in enabling others to do their work more efficiently, and I still am interested in how technology can enable us to live more simple lives. My recent work has touched marketing increasingly—I've been realizing how a good product can drive great technical work. And I've been enjoying playing with AI tools and looking for novel applications of them.
            
            Outside of engineering, I'm interested in luxury brands, philosophy, theology, medieval history, and modern trends. I like the social side of gaming. I like reading deep books and thinking big thoughts.
